Luxury Watch Dataset Analysis

Introduction:
The objective of this analysis is to explore the differences and similarities between luxury, mid-range, and non-luxury watches, focusing on the materials used and the complications present in these categories. We analysed data from a comprehensive watch dataset, segmenting brands into these three categories based on a consensus of luxury status. Using statistical tools, we aimed to understand patterns in case materials, bracelet materials, lunette materials, and complications across these segments. I used the 20 most popular brands within the dataset covering the 3 price ranges.  Within the luxury brands I used 25% of Rolex watches as they were too dominant across the range thus eliminating skewed data.
Methodology:
We segmented the dataset into three categories: Luxury, Mid-Range, and Non-Luxury. Brands such as Rolex, Patek Philippe, and Audemars Piguet were classified as luxury, while brands like Omega and TAG Heuer were considered mid-range. Non-luxury watches included lesser-known or lower-priced brands. Our analysis primarily focused on four key attributes: Lunette Material, Case Material, Bracelet Material, and Complication (e.g., automatic, hand-wound, quartz). Chi-square tests were conducted to determine if there were statistically significant differences between the watch categories for each attribute.
Results:
Visualizations were created to highlight the distribution of materials and complications across luxury, mid-range, and non-luxury watches. Some key findings include:
•	Lunette Material: Luxury watches favoured high-end materials such as White Gold (13.5%) and Yellow Gold (18.6%), while Steel was predominant in all categories but most common in Non-Luxury watches (70.4%). Surprisingly, Ceramic was common across all categories, with mid-range watches using it the most (17.8%).
•	Case Material: Steel was overwhelmingly dominant across all categories, with Luxury watches showing more variety, using materials like Gold/Steel and Platinum. However, Mid-Range and Luxury watches both utilized Titanium and Rose Gold, revealing a surprising overlap in material choices.
•	Bracelet Material: Again, Steel was the most common bracelet material, but Luxury watches distinguished themselves with materials like Platinum and Rose Gold. Interestingly, mid-range watches also frequently used materials like Crocodile-Leather, a feature typically associated with luxury.
•	Complications: Automatic movements dominated in the Luxury (95.9%) and Mid-Range (78.9%) categories. Quartz movements were much more common in Non-Luxury watches (17.3%) but also appeared in a small portion of mid-range watches (10.2%).
Statistical Insights:
We performed Chi-square tests to statistically analyse the differences between the categories for each of the four attributes:
•	Lunette Material: The Chi-square value was 19,765 with a p-value of 0.0, indicating significant differences between the categories. However, the use of Ceramic across all categories was a notable similarity.
•	Case Material: The Chi-square value was 13,547, also with a p-value of 0.0, demonstrating significant differences. Still, Steel was highly favoured across all segments, especially in mid-range and non-luxury watches.
•	Bracelet Material: This attribute showed the greatest variety, with a Chi-square value of 30,150. Although Steel was the most common material, the luxury category showed more diversity with Platinum and White Gold.
•	Complications: The test resulted in a Chi-square value of 11,735, with luxury and mid-range watches favouring automatic movements. However, a larger percentage of Quartz movements in mid-range watches was an unexpected finding.
Conclusion:
The analysis revealed distinct material preferences among luxury, mid-range, and non-luxury watches, with luxury watches unsurprisingly favouring precious materials like Gold and Platinum. However, mid-range watches showed surprising overlaps with luxury watches, particularly in the use of materials like Ceramic, Titanium, and Crocodile-Leather. These findings suggest that mid-range brands are increasingly adopting luxury elements, potentially blurring the lines between the two segments. Despite these overlaps, Quartz movements remain a key differentiator for non-luxury watches, while automatic movements dominate the higher-end categories.
